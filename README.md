# Digital Image Processing – Assignment- 1 

This repository contains  implementation of **basic image enhancement techniques** using Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.  
The code is written in a Jupyter Notebook and demonstrates how different transformations affect an image.  

---

## Techniques Implemented
- Brightness Improvement  
- Brightness Reduction  
- Thresholding  
- Negative Transformation  
- Logarithmic Transformation  
- Power-Law (Gamma) Transformation  

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)  
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)  
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)  

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DIP-Assignment1.git
   cd DIP-Assignment1



    Output Preview
The notebook displays the following results for the input image:

Original grayscale image

Brightness ↑ / ↓

Thresholded binary image

Negative transformation

Logarithmic transformation

Gamma corrected image

Each result is shown both visually (images) and numerically (pixel values).

 # Applications
 
Medical imaging (X-ray enhancement)

Photography and image editing

Remote sensing image analysis

Preprocessing for computer vision tasks
